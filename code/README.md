**This code was written for qiskit version 0.19.6**  
**It may need updating for future versions of qiskit**

qc_floquet.py - The main functions used by other scripts.

qc_floquet_qiskit.py - Extends qc_floquet.py with functions that use qiskit. These include functions that produce pulse sequences and run jobs on the IBM quantum computers.

device_run.py - Script to run the experiments on the IBM quantum computers.

chern_simulation.py - Script to perform numerical simulations to extract the Chern number. For comparison with the experimental data.

error_simulation.py - Script to perform numerical simulations of the simple error model presented in the paper.

The remaining scripts produce the figures presented in the paper [[arXiv:2012.01459](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01459)]
